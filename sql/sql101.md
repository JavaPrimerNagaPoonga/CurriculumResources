# Databases & SQL

### Overview

1.  Databases
2.  Structured Query Language
3.  Keys!
4.  Joins
5.  Functions
6.  Normalization

## 1. Databases

-   organized collection of structred or data
-   stored on computer
-   **persistant** storage of data
    -   data storage is retained after a device is powered off
-   **\*Spreadsheets vs Databases**
    -   Spreadsheets
        -   One-off analysis
        -   Quickly need chart or some type visualizaton
        -   SMaller in scale
    -   **Databases**
        -   data integrity
        -   Massive amounts of data
        -   quickly combine different datasets
        -   Automate steps for re-usability

### Database Management Systems(DBMS)

-   Softwar that was diesnged to store, manage and access data.
-   Serves as our interface
-   **CRUD**
    -   *C*reate
    -   *R*ead
    -   *U*pdate
    -   *D*elete
-   Types of DBMS:
    -   **Relational**
    -   distributed
    -   hierarchical
    -   object-orient

### Relation Database Management System (RDBMS)

-   _Adavanced_ version
-   Around '70s
-   Stores and provides us data that is **related/connected** to each other
    -   increase query
-   Based around normalization data redundancy
-   **Schema**
    -   THe rueles and structure of your database
-   **SQL** exlcusively used for relation databases
-   _Flavors_
    -   Microsoft SQL Server
    -   Oracle
    -   IBM Db2
    -   MySQL
        -   free
        -   reading information
    -   PostgreSQL
        -   reading and writing
        -   free
        -   enterprise applications

# Structured Query Language(SQL)

## Syntax

-   All the comands that start
-   SQL is actually **case_insensitive**
-   Columns
    -   snake_case
    -   all_letters_are_lower_case_and_dillineated_by_underscores
    -   snakeCase _This is Camel Case_

```sql
-- both commands are the same, CAPITILAZATION is from the programmer to
-- deliminate the commands
SELECT * FROM players;
select * from players;
```

## Sub-Languages of SQL

### DDL - Data Definition Language

-   Anthing thats defining your **schema**
-   Creation and modify the \*_structure_ of your databases objects
    -   -   **NOT** with data
    -   create, alter, drop, truncate
    -   **DROP** - deletes everything **ALL DATA AND STRUCTURE**
    -   **TRUNCATE** - deletes every record(row) of your table and **MAINTAINS** the structure(schema)

#### Constraints

-   put **restrictions** on what each attribute(column value) on table
-   primary key
    -   not null
    -   unique
-   foreign key
-   not null
-   check
-   unique

### DML - Data Manipulation Langugage

-   Anthing that manipulates the actual records data
    -   insert
    -   update set
    -   delete

### DQL - Data Query Language

-   Any statement reads data
-   Results compiled into a temporary table
-   select

```sql
select * from players;
select slugging,doubles,rbis from player;
```

### DCL - Data Control Langugae

-   Grant permissions or Revoking them
-   grant and revoke

### TCL - Transaction Control Language

-   Repsonsible for creating and saving transaction
-   **Transactions** are any command performing CRUD operations
    -   updates
    -   deletes
    -   inserts
    -   create
-   JDBC and DBeaver "auto-commit"
-   \*\*Transac
-   commit
    -   commits the whole transaction
-   rollback
    -   returns to previous commit
-   savepoint
    -   save my transaction here

## Transactions

-   A discreate unit of on to many sql
-   All RDBMS strive to make thair transactions **ACID** compliant
    -   *A*tomicity
        -   all statemnet in a transaction with commit at the end or the will rolled back
    -   *C*onsistent
        -   never a midway save point in a transaction
    -   *I*solation
        -   concurrent transactions do not step on each other
        -   alter data in a way that may influence another transaction
    -   *D*urability
        -   FAILS GRACEFULLY
            -   no data corruption

# KEYS

-   **Primary Key**
    -   **uniquely asssigned** identifier
-   **Foreign Key**
    -   constraint that you can put on a column
    -   that column must refer to a unique oclumn in another table
    -   Table with the foreign **CHILD**
        -   can have duplicate foreignkeys in a column
    -   Table the key refers **PARENT**
-   **Composite Key**
    -   two or more columns that make up a primary
    -   **THESE CAN BE PRIMARY KEYS**
-   **Candidate key**
    -   column that can **ACT** as a primary
    -   isn't neccessarily defined a a primary key

## REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY

-   Foriegn keys must always point to a valid record
    -   **oprhan records**
-   **CAN** use on delete cascade

# Join Operators

-   Normalized databses the data is spread out across multiple tables
    -   can it make it diffucult
-   Joins to combine tables horizontally based on the pjoin predicate 'on'

```sql
-- Joining any overlapping information from the coach table to the player table
select * from player left join coach on player.team_id = coaches.team_id;

right join -- all records on the right table plus matches to the left
inner join -- only records that match
self join -- think of employees, with managers and workers relating
cross join -- every record matched with every record
```

### UNION

-   Combine the result set of two or more selects statements on top on one another
-   logically speaking

# Normalization

-   Reduce the reudnancy of our data
    -   Redundant data = useless data = sotred in more than one place
-   Divides these largers tables into smaller tables and link them with relations
-   Normalized forms(NF)
    -   1-6NF
    -   **Industry Standard** 3NF
-   **Isn't always a good thing**
    -   **Pros**
        -   Increase in transsaction
        -   Decrease of stored information
    -   **Cons**
        -   makes the data more difficult to query
-   **Entity Relationship Diagrams(ERD)**
    -   Shows entities(tables) in our database and our relationship between them

# 1NF

-   All Records must be uniquely identified
    -   priamry key (composite primary)
-   All data in table should be atomic
    -   cannot break into smaller and more meaningful units
-   Disallows muli-valued and composite attributes and their combination
    -   list structure
    -   array-like

## Example: 1NF

### Suppose we want to store our employees phone numbers and location

<hr>

## Employee Table

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Employee Phone      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 29          | Ashwin        | 476487468           |
| 29          | Ashwin        | 476487468           |
| 39          | Adam          | 474749498,974647494 |
| 49          | Ben           | 3838749043,47349844 |
| 59          | Charles       | 3242355233          |

## Employee Phone

| Employee ID | Employee Phone | Employee Name |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 29          | 476487468      | Ashwin        |
| 39          | 974647494      | Adam          |

| 59          | 324235523      | Charles       |

## 2NF

-   in 1NF
-   All non-key attributes are **fully functionally dependent** on the whole of primary key
    -   every column that isn't the primary key is dependent on the whole of primary key
-   Relation with a **single-attribute** priamry key it's automatically in at least 2NF
    ## Example

### Suppose we wanted a table with all of the training offered here & who teaches them

| Employee ID | Curriculum ID | Curriculum                | Cost      | StartDate |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |

## Training per Employee

### NOTE CReating a junction table

    - compositie priamry key of Employee ID and Curriculum ID

| Employee ID | Curriculum ID | StartDate |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- |

# 3NF

-   no transitive functional dependency
-   non-primary keys that are dependent on another one

## Employee Location Table

-   THIS IS 2NF

    | Employee ID(PK) | Employee Name | Position           | State | ZIP   | City         |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ------------ |

## Multiplicities

-   1-1
    -   one record matches one record in another tabl
-   One to Many
    -   one record that matches to many records in another
-   Many-to-Many

    -   JUNCTION TABLE
    -   FK-FK = composite

    ## Functions

    -   **Scalar** functions
        -   Take in a single input and give single output

```sql
upper(name);
lower(name);
length(name);
```

-   **Aggregate** Function
    -   taking in multiple inputs and giving a single output
    -   Can be pair with groups

```sql
avg(goals)
sum(goals)
min(goals)
max(goals)
```
