Java Compiler. 

Java is knonw for being WORA, wwrite once run anywhere. 
This is because of the JVM. 

The compiler, that we get from the JDK will turn source code (what we write) into bytecode. 

That bytecode can be executed on any system, that has a JVM. The JVM will translate the 
	bytecode into machine specific code.

	Java Development Kit - this is what we need create and run Java applications. 
	Contains: JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compiler, and lots of other useful stuff.
